# utube-comment-sentiment-analysis
A lightweight NLP-based plugin that detects the sentiment of YouTube comments, with a focus on educational channels.
The model is trained on Reddit comments datasets, which offer diverse and real-world textual data suitable for sentiment classification.

 **Overview**

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to automatically evaluate the emotional tone of YouTube comments — whether they are positive, negative, or neutral.

Although the final application targets YouTube comment sections, the model has been pre-trained on Reddit comment datasets due to their large size and rich emotional variety, helping the model generalize well to social media language patterns.

**Why Reddit Dataset?**

Reddit is one of the largest social discussion platforms.
Its comment datasets are ideal for sentiment analysis because they:

Contain millions of labeled text samples across diverse topics.

Reflect real-world internet conversation style, including slang, sarcasm, and emojis.

Provide better generalization for models that later analyze YouTube comments.

Training on Reddit data ensures the model understands human emotion in informal text better than models trained only on formal reviews.

**Features**

 Sentiment detection (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
 Model trained on Reddit comments dataset
 Comment cleaning and preprocessing (stopword removal, punctuation stripping, lemmatization)
 Visualization of sentiment trends across YouTube channels
 Easily deployable as a plugin or standalone script
